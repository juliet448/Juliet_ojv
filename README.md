### PROJECT 2B: SEGMENTATION CUSTOMERS FOR A SUBSCRIPTION  USING SQL
---
In order to find trends and segmentation, this project entails analyzing customert data for a subscription service. Understanding consumer behavior, monitoring subscription typess, and seeing important patterns in cancellations and renewals are your objectives. For this project, a dataset is analyzed and valuable insights are extracted using SQL (Structured Query Language). The goal is to demonstrate how SQL may be used to query, manipulate, and change data in order to detect trends, solve business problems, and produce useful results. Data filtering, aggregation, joins, and subqueries are just a few of the SQL commands and strategies that will be used while working with a structured database.

###  TOOLS USE
SQL Management Studio by Microsoft

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 
---
Create queries based on the following questions to glean important insights.
o Retrieve the total sales for each product category.
o Find the number of sales transactions in each region.
o Find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
o Calculate total revenue per product.
